# OpenUPM: Tick Collection  

When you’re not using No-Code plugins, your code tends to get cluttered with repetitive lines like:  
- `Start()`, `Enable()`, `Disable()`, `Awake()`  
- `OnEnterInputN()`, `OnExitInputY()`  
- `OnMouseDown()`, `OnCollision()`, and so on...  

This tool provides `TickMono_` events, which are part of the official Unity lifecycle but are exposed as UnityEvents for easier drag-and-drop usage.  

I’ve designed them with a low probability of being renamed to avoid breaking the project, but this is not a guaranteed solution. It's primarily intended for prototyping rather than production.  

For production-ready code, consider using No-Code tools, state machines, or other robust solutions.
